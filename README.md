# Create a Shipping List App

## Instructions:

Create a React application that allows users to add and remove items from a shipping list. The app should have the following functionality:

1. Display a list of shipping items. (Use provided data set)
```sh
["Acrylic Prime Galvalume Coil", "BTP Prime Aluminum Coil", "Painted Prime Galvalume Coil", "Red Oxide Purlin"]
```
2. Allow users to add new shipping items.
3. Allow users to mark items as completed or uncompleted.
4. Allow users to remove items from the list.

## Requirements:

1. Use React to build the application.
2. Use state to manage the list of shipping items.
3. Implement a form for adding new shipping items.
4. Each shipping item should have a checkbox to mark it as completed/uncompleted.
5. Include a button to remove items from the list.

## Bonus (optional):

1. Add styling to make the app visually appealing.
2. Implement a "Clear Completed" button that removes all completed items from the list.
3. Add animations or transitions for adding/removing items.

## Building and Running Environment

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

To run react application:

```sh
npm run dev
```
